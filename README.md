# Mangrove Vulnerability
*Mangrove Vulnerability* is a long-term modelling study investigating the reponses of mangrove vulnerability under sea-levle rise and human pressure in different coastal conditions, including tides, waves, sediment supply and coastal slopes. Results and methods are described in [Xie et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc122) and [Xie et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006301).

## Schematic overview of the bio-morphodynamic modelling approach

## Highlights
###### 1. Multi-species mangrove assemblages in response to sea-level rise and human pressure ([Xie et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc122))

<div align="center">
  Bio-morphodynamic feedbacks can decouple accretion rates from inundation time, altering mangrove habitat conditions and causing mangrove diversity loss even when total forest coverage remains constant or is increasing.

###### 2. Mangrove vulnerability to sea-level rise in different coastal conditions ([Xie et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006301).)

<div align="center">
  Mangroves in micro-tidal conditions are more vulnerable to SLR and landward habitat can be created even with limited sediment supply and thus without complete infilling of the available accommodation space.

## Model Installation and Setup
When it is the first time for you to use this model, several processes should be done before the model simulations:
1)	***Installation***<br/>
Check whether both the Delft3D and Matlab are installed correctly, both of which should be successfully run independently on their own working environment.

2)	***Deltares OpenEarth Matlab Tools*** <br/>
Since the vegetation coupling relies on external MATLAB functions, it requires the installation of the OpenEarth tool box. Please install the OpenEarth Matlab Tool box through the link: https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/OET/MATLAB  

3)	***Settings of Startrun.bat***<br/>
For D3D open-source the Startrun.bat file needs to point to d_hydro.exe, which will generate the executable: "call C:\... \Delft3D 4.01.00\win32\flow2d3d\bin\d_hydro.exe"
(tested with Delft3D open-source-tag: 7545, compiled with Intel Fortran on Windows 10, Matlab 2017a)

4)	***Directory settings in Matlab***<br/>
Change working directory and add Deltares OpenEarth matlab Tools to Matlab environment in the lines 16 and 26 of "general_input.m", respectively.

5)	***More detail instructions can be related to the technical document***
